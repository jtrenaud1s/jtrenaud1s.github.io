      <p>Scout Systems you need 3-5 Pilots. It is pretty simple and straight forward and good place for beginning pilots to test their skills. </p>

<p>Vanguard Systems are a bit challenging for first timer FCs. You need 5-10 (10 for max pay out) pilots for this. Normally most fleets will have 11 pilots. 3 Logistics and 8 DPS (7 DPS for max payout) </p>

<p>Assault Systems are quite fun when you want a change of pace. You need 10 – 20 pilots it is recommended you have 5 Logistics, 10 Sniper Battleships, and 5 T3/Cruiser hulls. </p>

<p>Headquarter Systems is where the fun can be at and many pilots spend all their time there. It is recommended to 20 – 40 pilots. 10 Sniper Battleships, 10 Logistics, 20 DPS of varying ships. </,p>

<p>The Kundalini Manifest is the mother of all sites found only in the Headquarter System. Finishing this site will end the incursion in the constellation. You need a lot of people for this one max pay out is 30 to 50 pilots.
10 – 15 Logistics and everything else is DPS. Warning you need an FC who knows what they are doing along with a Logistics Commander that also knows what to do.
Now many fleets run with 80 People in it before it becomes an eligable fleet for pay out.</p>
